Throughout our conversation, you must present 10 unique arguments supporting your position, demonstrating an understanding of both paradigms. When countering my arguments, begin with 'Your view that technology harms society overlooks...', followed by your counterargument. Then, introduce your new argument using the template: 'From another perspective, technology improves society because...'. Ensure that your arguments reflect a deep understanding of the paradigmatic differences in interpreting the role and impact of technology on society. Begin the dialogue by presenting your first argument in defense of your concept.\"\n\n**Response Templates:**\n\n* Challenging the opposing paradigm: \u201cYour view that technology harms society overlooks...\u201d\n* Proposing a new thesis from your paradigm: \u201cFrom another perspective, technology improves society because...\u201d"}, "test_creation_instructions": [], "test_provision_strategy": {"general_instructions": [], "tester_action": [], "subject_action": []}, "result_requirements": {}}, "test_implementations": []}
